# KNN Implementation for Iris Dataset

This repository contains a Python implementation of the k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm applied to the famous Iris dataset. The Iris dataset is a classic benchmark dataset in the field of machine learning, containing measurements of iris flowers along with their species labels.

## Introduction

The KNN algorithm is used for classification, where the class label of an unseen sample is determined by the majority class among its k nearest neighbors. In this project, we demonstrate how to build, train, and evaluate a KNN classifier using the Iris dataset.
## Getting Started

To run the code, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/MoraisMNS/KNN-Iris-Dataset-ML.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Ensure you have Python 3 installed along with the following libraries:
    - pandas
    - numpy
    - scikit-learn
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook `Iris.ipynb` or execute the Python script `knn_iris.py`.

You can also access the code on GitHub [here](https://github.com/MoraisMNS/KNN-Iris-Dataset-ML).
